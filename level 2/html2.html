            <span>Genshin Impact[b] is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a service model.

                Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.
                
                Development of Genshin Impact began in 2017. The game generally received positive reviews, with critics praising its combat mechanics and the immersive open world but criticizing its simplistic endgame and monetization model. It had a first-year launch revenue of more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest for any video game, and a revenue of more than $4 billion as of March 2022.
                Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party.[2] Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks.[3] Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips.[4] In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, such as Stormterror and the Electro Hypostasis, but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time.[5] Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level.[6] The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.[7]

The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding, limited by stamina.[8][3] Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water, to create an ice path that can aid the player in traversing terrain.[3] Many teleportation nodes exist throughout the world that players can warp to as a form of fast travel; among these are landmarks known as Statues of The Seven that can heal and revive characters, and provide benefits such as increasing player stamina.[9] Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from a store. Furthermore, there are special battle instances called Domains that reward materials that increase character and weapon strength.[10] Ingredients that can be cooked into meals that regenerate characters' health or boost various stats.[11] Players can also procure ore that can be refined and then used to create weapons or enhance their strength.
